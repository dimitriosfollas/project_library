# Lending Library Management System

This small programming project started as a group assignment during the academic year 2023-2024 for the PLIPRO module of the Hellenic Open University. The aim of the project was to create a lending library management system. The requirements of the system were to manage:

  A) Member profiles: 
    Create a new member profile, renew registration, stop registering
    Update member details (in case any of a member's details change, e.g. address) 
    Statistics on members' preferences regarding borrowings, both per member, per book and per category.

  B) Borrowing Management: 
    Search for books to borrow according to appropriate keywords. 
    Check book availability depending on whether it is in stock.
    Cash update of a number of books after borrowing and returning them. 
    List of available books by category 
    Import new books and update library stocks
    Enter a new book category and update library inventory
