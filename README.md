# Lending Library Management System

## Description
This small programming project started as a group assignment during the academic year 2023-2024 for the PLIPRO module of the [Hellenic Open University](https://www.eap.gr/). Unfortunately, it was more of an individual assignment.

## Requirements
The aim of the project was to create a lending library management system using the Python programming language. The requirements of the system were to manage:

A) Member profiles: 
  1. Create a new member profile, renew registration, cancel registration
  2. Update member details (if any of a member's details change, e.g. address) 
  3. Statistics on member borrowing preferences, both per member, per book and per category.


B) Borrowing management: 
  1. Search for books to borrow using appropriate keywords. 
  2. Check availability of books according to whether they are in stock.
  3. Cash update of a number of books after borrowing and returning. 
  4. List available books by category 
  5. Import new books and update library holdings
  6. Enter new book category and update library stock
